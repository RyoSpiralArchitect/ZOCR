# Pricing (Draft) / 料金（ドラフト）

This document is a **non-binding draft** intended to make commercial discussions easier.
Final terms are provided in a separate commercial agreement. This is **not legal advice**.

## Commercial license (On‑prem / internal)

For organizations that need terms beyond AGPL (e.g., keep modifications proprietary, run a private service, obtain support/SLA).

**Scope (default):**
- Single legal entity
- Internal use (no redistribution to third parties unless explicitly agreed)
- Updates included during the contract term

### Tiers (JPY, excl. tax)

| Tier | Intended use | Price |
|---|---|---:|
| PoC / Pilot | Evaluation / non-production | ¥500,000 / 3 months |
| Production Basic | Small internal deployment | ¥3,000,000 / year |
| Production Pro | Multiple teams / higher volume | ¥6,000,000 / year |
| Enterprise | High-volume, SLA, custom needs | From ¥10,000,000 / year |

**Typical add-ons (examples):**
- Extra environments (beyond the agreed baseline): from ¥600,000 / year
- Higher volume / performance requirements: priced per page/doc and hardware profile
- Priority security response / SLA uplift: varies by target response window
- Professional services (integration, domain tuning, bespoke exporters): ¥150,000 / day

See `SUPPORT.md` for support options and response windows.

## Managed service (SaaS / private hosting)

We operate Z-OCR as a service (managed updates, monitoring, backups), typically for clients who prefer usage-based pricing.

### Tiers (JPY, excl. tax)

| Tier | Included volume (per month) | Price |
|---|---:|---:|
| Starter | 20,000 pages | ¥200,000 / month |
| Growth | 80,000 pages | ¥500,000 / month |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

**Overage (example):** from ¥5 / page (depends on OCR engine choices, doc complexity, and latency targets).
