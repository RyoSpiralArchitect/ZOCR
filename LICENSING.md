# Licensing / ライセンス

## TL;DR

- **Open Source**: AGPL-3.0-or-later (see `LICENSE`)
- **Commercial**: available under a separate paid license (see `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`)

---

## Open Source (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

Z-OCR is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later).

If you run a modified Z-OCR as a network service, the AGPL generally requires that you offer the corresponding source code of your modified version to users interacting with it over the network. (See the full text in `LICENSE`.)

---

## Commercial License (Dual Licensing)

If you want to use Z-OCR in a way that does **not** fit your AGPL compliance requirements (e.g., you want to keep modifications proprietary while providing a hosted service), you can obtain a commercial license from the copyright holder(s).

## Contributing and Dual-Licensing

Dual licensing is easiest when the project can relicense contributions under commercial terms.

- For small fixes, we usually accept contributions under AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- For substantial contributions, we may ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) so the project can continue offering commercial licenses.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
