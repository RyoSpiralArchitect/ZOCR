# Commercial Licensing / 商用ライセンス

## Overview

Z-OCR is **dual-licensed**:

- **AGPL-3.0-or-later** for open source use (see `LICENSE`)
- **Commercial license** for organizations that need different terms

This file is an informational pointer. Commercial terms are provided in a separate agreement.

## When you probably need a commercial license

- You run Z-OCR (or a modified version) as part of a **network-accessible service** and you do not want to disclose your modifications under AGPL.
- You need **warranty/indemnity/support/SLA** terms.
- You need license terms compatible with internal policy (e.g., no copyleft obligations).

## How to get one

Open a licensing request and include:

- Your use case (on-prem / SaaS / embedded)
- Expected scale (docs/day, users, regions)
- Whether you need support/SLA
